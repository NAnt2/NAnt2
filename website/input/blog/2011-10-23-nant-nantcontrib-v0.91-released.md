Sorry for the year long waitâ€¦.

We are proud to announce the final release of NAnt/NAntContrib 0.91.

This release focuses on extending our already strong support for multiple target frameworks (including .NET 4.0, Mono 4.0, Silverlight, etc), bringing improved flexibility and performance. A number of outstanding issues have been fixed as well.

A roadmap has been created to help illustrate the current release plan. Please note that this roadmap is a work in progress and is subject to change depending on feature priorities, issues, and developer's comfort level with the release:
