We are proud to announce the final release of NAnt/NAntContrib 0.92 Alpha1.

This marks the first release since the NAnt project relocated its repos to github.com. NAnt's github.com home page for both NAnt and NAntContrib can be found at https://github.com/nant. While current and future development will occur at github.com, the existing SF.net project pages will continue to host all of the release and nightly builds.

This release focuses on fixing issues on both projects while introducing new features that we feel add greater flexibility and performance. Details of these changes may be found in the release notes of each project's homepage.

Binary and source distributions are available for immediate download from:
NAnt:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/nant/files/nant/0.92-alpha1/

NAntContrib:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/nantcontrib/files/nantcontrib/0.92-alpha1/

The GIT tag for NAnt/NAntContrib 0.92 Alpha1 is:
rel-0-92-alpha1

Discussion of NAnt occurs on the mailing list at nant-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
