Announcing NAnt 0.90-rc1

The first release candidate of NAnt 0.90 has been released. Please continue to test and report bugs so we can make the final release of 0.90 the best it can be.

A roadmap has been created to help illustrate the current release plan. Please note that this roadmap is a work in progress and is subject to change depending on feature priorities, issues, and developer's comfort level with the release:

Unless there are any real show stoppers reported, we will be moving the final release up one week from May 15th to May 9th. From there we will begin focusing our attention to 0.91.

This release focuses on extending our already strong support for multiple target frameworks, bringing improved flexibility and performance. A number of outstanding issues have been fixed as well.
