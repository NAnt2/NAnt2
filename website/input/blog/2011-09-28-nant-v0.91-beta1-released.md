We are proud to announce the first beta release of NAnt 0.91.

Many thanks to those who were involved with the development of NAnt
this past year. Especially to Martin Aliger and Dominik Guder without
whom this release would not have been possible without.

The primary goal for this release is to continue to improve support
for .NET 4.0. Please give this release a test and report any NAnt
core specific bugs back along with examples as soon as you can.

This release focuses on extending our already strong support for
multiple target frameworks, bringing improved flexibility and
performance. Some show stopping issues have been resolved as well.

A roadmap has been created to help illustrate the current release
plan. Please note that this roadmap is a work in progress and is
subject to change depending on feature priorities, issues, and
developer's comfort level with the release:
