We are proud to announce the second alpha release of NAnt 0.91.

The primary goal for this release is to continue to improve support for .NET 4.0. Please give this release a test and report any NAnt core specific bugs back along with examples as soon as you can.

This release focuses on extending our already strong support for multiple target frameworks, bringing improved flexibility and performance. Some show stopping issues have been resolved as well.

A roadmap has been created to help illustrate the current release plan. Please note that this roadmap is a work in progress and is subject to change depending on feature priorities, issues, and developer's comfort level with the release:
